# Planted Tile Growth System - Testing Guide

## System Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### What Has Been Implemented:

1. **✅ Dynamic Growth System in TileManager**
   - PlantedTileInfo data structure for tracking plant data
   - HashMap storage for planted tiles by grid coordinates
   - Growth calculation based on planting time and current game time
   - Image caching system for growth stage sprites
   - Sprite loading from RES/SEED/[seedname]/[seedname1.png, seedname2.png, etc.]

2. **✅ Map Rendering Integration** 
   - Modified Map.drawTile() to handle TILE_PLANTED specially
   - Creates TileManager instance when rendering planted tiles
   - Uses Tile.drawPlantedTileGrowth() delegation method for dynamic rendering
   - Fallback to static planted tile if TileManager not available

3. **✅ KeyHandler Integration**
   - P key for planting when holding a seed (with fallback to house placement)
   - H key for harvesting planted crops
   - Smart detection of seed holding via PlayerAction.getHeldSeedName()

4. **✅ PlayerAction Methods**
   - performPlanting(): Complete planting logic with energy cost (5), time cost (5 min), and seed consumption
   - performHarvesting(): Complete harvesting logic with crop addition to inventory
   - Energy validation and game time integration
   - Inventory management for seeds and crops

### How to Test:

1. **Start the Game**
   - Run the main game
   - Switch to Farm Map (press '2')

2. **Get Seeds**
   - Use store system to buy seeds
   - Select seeds in inventory (mouse click)

3. **Prepare Land**
   - Equip a Hoe from inventory
   - Hold 'C' key on tillable land to till it

4. **Plant Seeds**
   - Select a seed from inventory
   - Stand on tilled land
   - Press 'P' key to plant
   - Energy will be consumed (5 points)
   - Game time will advance (5 minutes)
   - Seed will be removed from inventory

5. **Watch Growth**
   - Plants automatically progress through growth stages
   - Each stage displays different sprite (seed1.png, seed2.png, etc.)
   - Growth based on game time (24 hours per stage)

6. **Harvest Crops**
   - When plant reaches final growth stage
   - Stand on planted tile
   - Press 'H' key to harvest
   - Crop will be added to inventory
   - Tile will return to tilled state

### Technical Architecture:

- **TileManager**: Handles all growth logic and data storage
- **Map.drawTile()**: Renders dynamic growth sprites for TILE_PLANTED
- **Tile.drawPlantedTileGrowth()**: Delegation method that calls TileManager
- **PlayerAction**: Handles planting/harvesting with proper validation
- **KeyHandler**: Integrates P/H keys with smart seed detection

### Key Features:

- ✅ Time-based growth (24 hours per stage)
- ✅ Dynamic sprite rendering based on growth stage
- ✅ Energy and time costs for farming actions
- ✅ Inventory integration (seed consumption, crop production)
- ✅ Proper validation (farm map only, correct tools/seeds)
- ✅ Image caching for performance
- ✅ Error handling and debug logging

### File Structure Expected:

```
RES/
  SEED/
    [seedname]/
      [seedname]1.png  # Stage 1 sprite
      [seedname]2.png  # Stage 2 sprite
      [seedname]3.png  # Stage 3 sprite
      ...
```

Example: RES/SEED/tomato/tomato1.png, RES/SEED/tomato/tomato2.png, etc.

## Status: READY FOR TESTING ✅

The complete planted tile growth system is now implemented and integrated into the game!
