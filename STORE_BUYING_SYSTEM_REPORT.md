- Routes store clicks to `gamePanel.getStoreUI().handleMouseClick()`

**StoreUI Mouse Support:**
- **Store slot selection:** Click on 4x4 store grid
- **Inventory slot selection:** Click on 4x4 inventory grid  
- **Button interactions:** Buy, Exit, Previous/Next category
- **Automatic selection switching** between store and inventory

### 4. Keyboard Controls
**Enhanced KeyHandler.java:**
- **ESC key handling** for STORE_STATE to exit back to PLAY_STATE
